# 🧪 Bayesian A/B Testing for Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

## Executive Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive statistical analysis platform for evaluating marketing campaign effectiveness using both traditional frequentist and modern Bayesian methodologies. The solution provides actionable business insights with quantified uncertainty, enabling data-driven decision making for marketing strategy optimization.

**Key Business Impact**: Enables marketing teams to make confident decisions about campaign strategies with clear risk assessment and revenue impact projections.

## 📊 Business Problem Statement

Marketing teams frequently struggle with:
- **Decision Uncertainty**: Traditional A/B tests provide binary significant/not-significant results without nuanced probability assessments
- **Risk Quantification**: Limited understanding of potential losses from incorrect decisions
- **Revenue Impact**: Difficulty translating statistical results into business metrics
- **Early Decision Making**: Need for interim analysis capabilities before reaching traditional statistical significance

This platform addresses these challenges by implementing a dual-methodology approach:

### Traditional Statistical Analysis
- **Two-proportion Z-tests** for hypothesis testing
- **Chi-square tests** for independence validation

## 🔍 Statistical Methodology

### Frequentist Approach
```mathematica
H₀: p₁ = p₂ (no difference in conversion rates)
H₁: p₁ ≠ p₂ (significant difference exists)

Test Statistic: Z = (p̂₁ - p̂₂) / SE_pooled
Critical Value: Z_α/2 at chosen significance level
```

### Bayesian Approach
```mathematica
Prior: Beta(α₀, β₀) for each group
Posterior: Beta(α₀ + successes, β₀ + failures)
P(Group B > Group A) = ∫∫ I(θ_B > θ_A) × f(θ_A, θ_B) dθ_A dθ_B
```
